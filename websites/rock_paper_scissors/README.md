### Rock Paper Scissors

## How to play
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- Rock: A closed fist.
- Paper: An open hand.
- Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a "V."

Rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).
- Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins).
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins).

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie. The game is often used as a decision-making tool or a fun way to pass the time.
